- better error handling in server side

- implement logging infrastructure, seems Slim has some functionality for that
  already so we can just use that

- get rid of Slim altogether and just implement the most basic stuff needed?

- implement token validation endpoint (similar to Ping Identity server)

- client_id cannot contain a ":" when it needs to use Basic authentication to
  the token endpoint

- validate redirect_uri on registration, it cannot contain '#'

- warn if not using SSL!

- SECURITY
  - look into htaccess Authorization header rewrite to make it work better!
